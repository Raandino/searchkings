This project is a responsive Landing page designed with scalability, performance, and ease of customization in mind. 
It leverages popular front-end tools and methodologies to ensure both a great user experience and maintainable code.

## Technologies Used

- **Bootstrap**: Used for a responsive, mobile-first layout with Bootstrap’s grid system, components, and utility classes.
- **Material Icons**: Integrated Google’s Material Icons for enhanced UI elements.
- **BEM Methodology**: To maintain a clean, modular, and scalable codebase. BEM ensures that CSS classes are named logically, making the styling easier to manage and extend.
- **Icon Font**: Custom icons were created using **IcoMoon**, allowing them to be used as a font. This approach optimizes performance and allows for easy customization (e.g., size, color) without additional image requests.
- **Vanilla CSS**: Used for custom styling with minimal media queries to take full advantage of Bootstrap’s responsive breakpoints. 

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: The project is optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktops. Bootstrap’s grid system and responsive classes, along with minimal custom media queries, ensure a seamless experience across devices.
- **Theme Customization**: The ability to change themes on the fly by clicking the floating icon, showcasing the level of customization available. This feature allows for dynamic styling and personalization.
